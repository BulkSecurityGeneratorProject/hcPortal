    <h6>Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute (bpm).
        The heart rate can vary according to the body's physical needs,
        including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide.
        It is usually equal or close to the pulse measured at any peripheral point.</h6>
