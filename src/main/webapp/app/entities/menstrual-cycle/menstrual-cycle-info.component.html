        The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and
        ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle is required for the production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus
        for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms
        during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation.
